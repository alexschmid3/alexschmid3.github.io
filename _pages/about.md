I am a fifth-year PhD student at the MIT Operations Research Center, advised by [Alexandre Jacquillat](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/ajacquillat/). My research focuses on large-scale optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis on transportation and logistics. I aim to develop scalable algorithms for coordinated vehicle routing to support emerging models for sustainable transportation. In the summer of 2023, I interned at Amazon Robotics to develop optimization algorithms for scheduling and coordination in robotic warehouses.
