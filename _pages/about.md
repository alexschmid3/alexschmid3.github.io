I am a fourth-year PhD student at the MIT Operations Research Center, advised by [Alexandre Jacquillat](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/ajacquillat/). My research focuses on large-scale optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis on transportation and logistics. I aim to develop scalable algorithms for coordinated routing of vehicles and robots to support emerging models for sustainable transportation. In the summer of 2023, I interned at Amazon Robotics to develop optimization algorithms for scheduling and coordination in robotic warehouses. 

In 2024, I won the MIT <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/community-diversity/awards-recognition/the-goodwin-medal/2024-schmid-rixey/">Goodwin Medal</a>, awarded annually to a graduate instructor "who has performed above and beyond the norm, and whose teaching efforts can truly be characterized as conspicuously effective."
