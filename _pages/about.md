I am a final year PhD student at the MIT Operations Research Center, advised by Alexandre Jacquillat. Broadly speaking, I aim to develop scalable algorithms for large-scale optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis on transportation and logistics. My PhD research tackles design and operations for emerging business models with an element of coordination. This coordination requires new models with complex synchronization constraints, and accompanying decomposition algorithms to handle them at scale. 

My research has been recognized as a finalist for the 2025 Tranportation and Logistics Society Best Student Paper Competition, and my teaching has been recognized with the 2024 MIT Goodwin Medal. In the summer of 2023, I interned at Amazon Robotics to develop optimization algorithms for scheduling and coordination of robotic drives in fulfillment centers.
