I am a second year PhD student at the MIT Operations Research Center, advised by Dr. [Alexandre Jacquillat](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/ajacquillat/). As part of my graduate work, I am modeling and developing algorithms for solving optimization problems in logistics, routing, warehousing, and robotics. I am also a Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing Scholar through the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing. 

Research Interests
======

My primary research interests include large-scale optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and interpretable machine learning and optimization, with an emphasis on applications in routing and transportation. Recently, I have been interested in applying machine learning to accelerate decomposition algorithms for integer and combinatorial optimization problems.
